# Clustering-algorithm
This code performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Main steps:

Load customer data from a CSV file

Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler

Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Apply K-Means to group customers into 4 clusters

Reduce data dimensionality using PCA (3D) and visualize clusters

Analyze average feature values for each cluster

Visualize results with a 3D scatter plot and a heatmap

This project is useful for customer behavior analysis and segmentation.
